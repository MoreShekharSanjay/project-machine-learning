# Machine Learning Projects

1) Breast Cancer Prediction:
    - We use logistic regression to classify breast cells into malignant or benign, based on features extracted from breast mass images.
    - Skills and software used: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, Jupyter Notebook, Python3
    - Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

2) Credit Card Fraud Detection:
    - We use PySpark and MLlib library to train a logistic regression model, to classify credit card transactions into normal or fraudulent.
    - PySpark and MLlib have been used due to the large size of the dataset.
    - Due to the class imbalance (only ~0.172% cases are frauds), Area under ROC Curve (AUC) has been used as a metric.
    - Skills and software used: PySpark, MLlib, Jupyter Notebook, Python3
    - Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

3) House Price Prediction:
    - We use linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict house prices in King County USA.
    - Skills and software used: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, Jupyter Notebook, Python3
    - Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
